# Website Accessibility Guide

This document provides a detailed description of the myrtle.moe website, designed to be read and understood by users who are blind or visually impaired. It describes the layout, colors, components, and functionality of each page.

## Global Layout

The entire website shares a common layout that consists of a header, a main content area, and a footer. The background of every page has a subtle decorative effect with large, blurred, colored circles that are positioned in the corners of the screen.

### Header

The header is a navigation bar that is fixed to the top of the screen. It has a modern, dark aesthetic with a blurred background that lets the content below it show through slightly. The header has a thin, glowing line at the bottom that gives it a futuristic feel.

The header is divided into three sections:

*   **Left:** A logo and the website's name, "myrtle.moe". The logo is a solid square with the primary color of the website. Clicking on the logo or the name takes you back to the home page.
*   **Center:** The main navigation for the website. This is a pill-shaped component with a list of links. When you hover over a link, a highlighted pill moves to that link with a smooth animation. The currently active page is also highlighted. The navigation items are:
    *   **Home:** A link to the home page.
    *   **Operators:** A dropdown menu with links to "Collection" and "Tier List".
    *   **Tools:** A dropdown menu with links to "Recruitment Calculator", "DPS Charts", and "Randomizer".
    *   **Players:** A dropdown menu with links to "Search Players" and "Leaderboard".
    *   **More (represented by an ellipsis icon):** A dropdown menu with links to "About", "Changelog", and "Terms".
*   **Right:** A set of icons and the user menu.
    *   **GitHub:** An icon that links to the project's GitHub page.
    *   **Theme Toggle:** A button that opens a dropdown menu to change the website's theme. You can choose between "Light", "Dark", and "System" modes. You can also customize the accent color of the website using a color picker or a set of predefined presets.
    *   **User Menu / Login:**
        *   If you are logged in, this is a dropdown menu that shows your avatar, username, and level. It contains links to your profile and the settings page, as well as a "Logout" button.
        *   If you are not logged in, this is a "Login" button. Clicking it opens a dialog.

#### Login Dialog

The login dialog is a pop-up window with a modern, morphing animation. It allows you to log in to the website using your YoStar email. The process is as follows:

1.  You enter your email address and select your game server (Global, JP, KR, etc.).
2.  You click "Send OTP", and a 6-digit code is sent to your email.
3.  You enter the 6-digit code into the dialog and click "Login".

The dialog also contains a detailed explanation of how the login process works and a disclaimer about using the tool.

### Footer

The footer is at the bottom of the page. It has a simple layout with a top border. It contains:

*   A copyright notice: "© 2025 Myrtle".
*   Links to "About", "Privacy", and "Terms".
*   Icons that link to the project's GitHub and Twitter pages.

## Home Page

The home page is the main landing page of the website. It is designed to be visually impressive and to give you a quick overview of what the website has to offer. It is divided into five main sections, stacked vertically.

### 1. Hero Section

This is the first thing you see when you visit the website. It's a large, full-width section with a lot of animation and visual effects, designed to grab your attention.

*   **Appearance:**
    *   In **dark mode**, the background is a slow-moving collage of artwork from the game Arknights. The images are slightly blurred and have a low opacity, giving them a subtle, dream-like quality. There's also a "vignette" effect, which makes the center of the screen brighter and the edges darker, focusing your attention on the text in the middle.
    *   In **light mode**, the image collage is replaced with a warm, orange and yellow gradient.
    *   The main text has a glowing effect that matches the website's accent color.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Headline:** A large, bold headline that reads "Sync, discover, and optimize your". The last word of the headline is an animated text loop that cycles through the words: "operators", "roster", "recruitment", "profile", and "progress".
    *   **Subtitle:** A smaller line of text below the headline that reads "The ultimate toolkit for Arknights Doctors."
    *   **Buttons:** Two buttons are centered below the subtitle.
        *   The primary button is large, has a solid background with the website's accent color, and reads "Browse Operators". When you hover over it, it glows and grows slightly larger. It takes you to the "Operators" page.
        *   The secondary button has an outline style and reads "Get Started". When you click it, the page smoothly scrolls down to the "Features" section.

### 2. Features Section

*   **Appearance:** The section has a title that reads "How it works" and a subtitle. The main content is a two-column layout of four "steps". The background has some large, decorative, blurred circles of color.
*   **Content:** Each step is presented in a card-like container with a number, a title, a description, and a button. When you hover over a step, a button appears with a call to action.
    1.  **Connect Your Account:** Explains that you can link your Arknights profile. The button opens the login dialog.
    2.  **Explore & Discover:** Encourages you to browse the operator database and tier lists. The button links to the "Operators" page.

### 4. Stats Section

This section displays some impressive statistics about the website to build trust and social proof.

*   **Appearance:** The section has a title that reads "Trusted by Doctors worldwide" and a subtitle. The main content is a grid of four cards.
*   **Content:** Each card displays a statistic with a large, animated number that counts up when it comes into view. When you hover over a card, a subtle gradient appears in the background. The four stats are:
    1.  **300+ Operators:** In the complete database.
    2.  **50K+ Active Users:** In the global community.
    3.  **1M+ Calculations:** Performed per month.
    4.  **99.9% Uptime:** For a reliable service.

### 5. CTA (Call to Action) Section

This is the final section of the home page, designed to encourage you to get started.

        *   "Get Started": A primary button that links to the "Operators" page.
        *   "View All Tools": A secondary button that links to the "Tools" page.

## Operators List Page

This page allows you to browse, search, filter, and sort all the operators available in the game. It is a powerful tool for exploring the operator database.

### Layout and Controls

The page has a main title that reads "Operators". Below the title, there is a set of controls to help you find the operators you're looking for.

*   **Search Bar:** A text input field where you can type the name, class, or archetype of an operator to quickly find them.
*   **View Toggle:** A set of two buttons that lets you switch between a "Grid View" and a "List View".
    *   In **Grid View**, operators are displayed in a compact grid of cards.
    *   In **List View**, operators are displayed in a more detailed list. You can also choose to display the list in 1, 2, or 3 columns on larger screens.
*   **Sort Controls:** A dropdown menu to sort the operators by various criteria like Rarity, Name, Class, HP, ATK, DEF, etc. Next to it is a button to switch between ascending and descending order.
*   **Filter Button:** A button that opens a detailed filter menu. The button shows a count of how many filters are currently active.

### Operator Filters

The filter menu is a pop-up window that allows you to refine the list of operators based on a wide range of criteria. It is divided into two sections:

*   **Basic Filters:**
    *   **Class:** A set of icons for each of the 8 main classes (Vanguard, Guard, Defender, etc.). You can select multiple classes.
    *   **Rarity:** A set of buttons to filter by rarity, from 1-star to 6-star. You can select multiple rarities.
*   **Advanced Filters:** A collapsible section that contains dropdown menus for more specific filtering. You can filter by:
    *   Archetype (e.g., Pioneer, Marksman)
    *   Gender
    *   Nation (e.g., Rhodes Island, Kazimierz)
    *   Faction (e.g., Blacksteel, Penguin Logistics)
    *   Race
    *   Place of Birth
    *   Artist

You can clear all active filters at once by clicking the "Clear all" button at the top of the filter menu.

### Operator Display

The main content of the page is the list or grid of operators.

*   **Grid View Card:**
    *   **Appearance:** A rectangular card with the operator's portrait as the main focus. The background has a very faint, large logo of the operator's faction. At the bottom, there is a semi-transparent bar with the operator's name and a colored line indicating their rarity.
    *   **Interaction:** When you hover your mouse over a card, the operator's portrait zooms in slightly, and a class icon appears in the corner. All other operator cards on the page become grayed out, making the hovered card stand out. If you keep your mouse over the card for a moment, a pop-up appears with more details: name, faction, rarity, archetype, position, and race. Clicking the card takes you to that operator's detailed page.

*   **List View Card:**
    *   **Appearance:** A horizontal bar with the operator's portrait on the left and their information on the right. A colored vertical line on the far left indicates the operator's rarity.
    *   **Content (Single Column):** In the default single-column view, the card is wide and displays the operator's Name, Rarity (as stars), Class (with icon), Archetype, and Faction (with logo).
    *   **Content (Multi-Column/Mobile):** In a multi-column or mobile view, the card is more compact. It shows the operator's name with their faction logo, and below that, a row with their rarity stars, class icon and name, and archetype.

### Pagination and Results

*   Below the controls, there is a line of text that tells you how many operators are being shown out of the total number of results (e.g., "Showing 1 to 48 of 312 operators").
*   At the very bottom of the page, there is a pagination control that allows you to navigate through the pages of results.
*   If your search or filter criteria do not match any operators, a message is displayed with a search icon, telling you that no operators were found and providing a button to clear your filters.

## Tier Lists Page

This page displays community-driven tier lists that rank operators based on their performance. The page has two different modes: an "index" mode that shows all available tier lists, and a "detail" mode that shows a specific tier list.

### Tier List Index Page

This is the default view of the page, showing a gallery of all available tier lists.

*   **Layout:** The page has a title that reads "Tier Lists" and a count of how many lists are available. The main content is a grid of cards, each representing a single tier list.
*   **Tier List Card:**
    *   **Appearance:** A rectangular card with a header and a content section. The header contains a preview of the top operators in that tier list, shown as a collage of their portraits. The content section displays the name of the tier list, a short description, the number of operators and tiers in the list, and the date it was last updated.
    *   **Interaction:** The entire card is a link to view the detailed tier list. When you hover over the card, the border and title change to the website's primary accent color, and an arrow icon appears next to the title, indicating that it's clickable.

### Tier List Detail Page

When you click on a tier list from the index page, you are taken to this view, which displays the full tier list in detail.

*   **Layout:** The page has a header with the name and description of the tier list. Below this, there is information about when the list was last updated and a button to view the changelog. The main body of the page is a vertical stack of "tier rows".
*   **Info & Changelog:**
    *   **Info Button:** A small button with a "question mark" icon opens a pop-up with two tabs. One tab explains how the tiers are defined (e.g., what "S+" tier means), and the other tab lists the criteria used for ranking the operators.
    *   **Changelog:** Clicking the version number (e.g., "v1.2") opens a dialog that shows the history of changes for that tier list. You can click on a specific version to see a more detailed changelog, including a summary and the full text of the changes for that version.
*   **Tier Row:**
    *   **Appearance:** Each tier in the list (e.g., S+, S, A, B) is represented by a horizontal row. On the left side of the row is a colored block with the name of the tier (e.g., "S+"). The color of the block corresponds to the tier's rank, ranging from red for the highest tiers to blue and green for the lower tiers. The text color on the block is automatically chosen to be either black or white for the best readability. If a tier has a description, an info icon appears next to the name, and clicking the label opens a dialog with the description.
    *   **Operators:** To the right of the tier label is a grid of all the operators ranked in that tier. Each operator is shown as a small card with their portrait.
*   **Operator Card & Tooltip:**
    *   **Appearance:** The operator cards are small and square, showing just the operator's portrait with a colored line at the bottom to indicate their rarity.
    *   **Interaction:** When you hover over an operator's card, their name appears in an overlay at the bottom of the card. At the same time, all other operators on the page become grayed out, making the hovered operator stand out. If you keep your mouse over the card, a tooltip appears with more detailed information, including the operator's name, faction, rarity, archetype, position, and race. Clicking the card takes you to that operator's detailed page.

## Recruitment Calculator Page

This page is a tool to help you find the best combinations of tags in the in-game recruitment to get the operators you want.

### Layout

The page is divided into three main sections:
1.  A header with the title "Recruitment Calculator".
2.  A "Select Tags" section where you choose the tags you see in the game.
3.  A "Results" section that shows you the possible outcomes based on the tags you've selected.

### Tag Selection

This section contains all the possible recruitment tags, grouped by type (Position, Class, Affix, etc.).

*   **Appearance:** Each group is a collapsible section with a title. Inside, the tags are displayed as buttons. The "Top Operator" and "Senior Operator" tags have special orange and yellow colors, respectively, to make them stand out.
*   **Interaction:** You can click on the tag buttons to select them. You can select up to 5 tags at a time. When a tag is selected, its appearance changes to the website's primary accent color. When you have selected the maximum number of tags, all other unselected tags become disabled and faded out. You can click the "Reset" button to clear all selected tags.

### Results

This section displays the possible outcomes based on your selected tags. The results are automatically calculated and updated as you select or deselect tags.

*   **Filter Options:** At the top of the results section, there are two switches:
    *   **Include Robots:** A switch to include or exclude robot operators from the results.
    *   **Show Common First:** A switch that changes the sort order of the operators within each result. By default, they are sorted by rarity from highest to lowest. When this is turned on, common operators (4-star, 3-star, 2-star) are shown before uncommon ones (5-star, 1-star).
*   **Combination Result:** Each possible combination of your selected tags is displayed in its own collapsible section.
    *   **Header:** The header of each section shows you the guaranteed rarity you will get with that combination (e.g., "5★~6★"), the tags in the combination, and the number of possible operators. Combinations that guarantee a 5-star or 6-star operator are highlighted with a yellow or orange border and background.
    *   **Content:** When you expand a section, it shows a grid of all the possible operators you can get with that tag combination.
*   **Operator Card:** Each operator in the results is shown as a small card with their portrait, name, rarity stars, and class icon.

## DPS Calculator Page

This page is a tool for theorycrafters that allows you to calculate and compare the Damage Per Second (DPS) of different operators under various conditions.

### Layout

The page has a header with the title "DPS Calculator" and is divided into two main sections:
1.  A "DPS Graph" section at the top, which displays the results as a line chart.
2.  An "Operators" section at the bottom, where you can add and configure the operators you want to compare.

### DPS Graph

This section contains the line chart that visualizes the DPS comparison.

*   **Appearance:** It's a standard line chart with a grid background. If no operators have been added, this area will be empty, prompting you to add an operator.
*   **Axes:** The horizontal X-axis represents the enemy's stats, while the vertical Y-axis represents the operator's DPS. You can switch the X-axis between "Defense" and "Resistance" using a pair of tabs at the top of the section.
*   **Lines:** Each operator you add to the comparison is represented by a colored line on the chart.
*   **Legend:** Below the chart, a legend lists the names of the operators and their specific configurations (e.g., "Surtr E2 P1 S3M3"), each with a colored key that matches their line on the chart.
*   **Tooltip:** When you move your mouse over the chart, a tooltip appears, showing the precise DPS value for each operator at the specific Defense or Resistance value under your cursor.

### Operator Configuration

This is where you build your comparison. It starts as an empty section with an "Add Operator" button.

*   **Adding an Operator:** Clicking the "Add Operator" button opens a dialog window.
    *   **Operator Selector:** This dialog contains a searchable list of all the operators available in the calculator. You can scroll through the list or use the search bar to find an operator by name or class. Operators that have already been added to the comparison will appear faded and cannot be selected again. Clicking on an operator adds them to the configuration section and closes the dialog.
*   **Configuring an Operator:** Each operator you add appears in their own collapsible section.
    *   **Header:** The header for each operator shows their name, rarity, and current skill/mastery level. It also has a trash can icon to remove the operator from the comparison. A colored line on the left matches the color of their line on the DPS chart.
    *   **Options:** When you expand an operator's section, you are presented with a variety of controls to configure their stats:
        *   **Skill:** A dropdown menu to select which skill to use in the calculation.
        *   **Mastery Level:** A slider to set the skill mastery level from 0 to 3.
        *   **Module:** A dropdown to select which module to equip (if the operator has one).
        *   **Potential:** A slider to set the potential from 1 to 6.
        *   **Trust:** A slider to set the trust percentage from 0 to 100.
        *   **Elite Level:** A dropdown to set the promotion level (e.g., Elite 0, Elite 1, Elite 2).
    *   Any changes made to these configurations will automatically update the DPS graph.
*   **Clearing All:** If you have added one or more operators, a "Clear All" button appears, allowing you to remove all of them at once.

## User Profile Page

This page displays a user's Arknights profile, including their owned operators, inventory, and base information.

    *   **Accordion:** An accordion at the bottom of the card can be expanded to show the operator's potential, skills, and unlocked modules.
    *   **Maxed Effect:** If an operator is fully maxed out (max level, potential, skills, and modules), their card has a glowing effect based on their rarity color.
    *   **Interaction:** Clicking on a card opens a dialog with even more details and a larger view of the artwork.
*   **Character Cards (Compact View):** This view shows a more condensed grid of smaller cards, inspired by the in-game character icons.
    *   **Appearance:** Each card is a small square that shows the operator's avatar. The character's name is at the top, and a colored border at the bottom indicates their rarity.
    *   **Badges:** Various icons and badges are overlaid on the card to show the operator's level, elite status, potential, skill levels, and unlocked modules. If the operator is fully maxed, most of these badges are hidden, and a "Maxed" badge appears over the avatar.

## Admin Panel

This page is a protected area for website administrators to manage content and view statistics. It is not accessible to regular users.

### Layout

The page has a header that welcomes the admin user and shows their role (e.g., "super_admin"). The main content is a dashboard composed of several sections.

    *   **Table Content:** Each row displays a user's avatar, nickname, UID, level, server, role, and the date they signed up.

*   **Tier List Management:** This is the most complex section, allowing admins to create, edit, and delete tier lists.
    *   **Table View:** By default, it shows a table of all tier lists, similar to the user management table. It includes columns for the tier list's name, status (active/inactive), number of tiers, operators, and versions, and the last updated date. Each row has an "Actions" menu with options to "View", "Edit", and "Delete" the tier list.
    *   **Editor View:** When an admin clicks "Edit" on a tier list, the view animates to a powerful editor interface.
        *   **Settings:** The admin can edit the tier list's name, description, and active status.
        *   **Tier Editor:** The main part of the editor allows full control over the tiers. Tiers are displayed as rows and can be reordered by dragging and dropping.
        *   **Tier Controls:** For each tier, the admin can change its name, color, and description.
        *   **Operator Editor:** Within each tier is a grid of operators. Operators can be reordered within a tier or dragged and dropped to a different tier. Each operator card has a remove button. An "Add Operator" button opens a dialog to search for and add new operators to the tier.
    *   **Saving and Publishing:** After making changes, the admin can save them. If there are unsaved changes, a badge will appear. Once saved, the admin can publish a new version, which prompts them to write a changelog.

*   **Recent Activity:** A list showing the most recent changes made to any of the tier lists, such as an operator being added or moved.
