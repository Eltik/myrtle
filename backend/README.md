An advanced Arknights helper that interacts with the game servers to fetch real-time data.

## Credits
Almost all backend credit goes to [thesadru and co.](https://github.com/thesadru/ArkPRTS) as a base. Huge thanks to them as I wouldn't have figured out 90% of the project without their repository.
